# Mad Libs Game
Mad Libs is a word game where players fill in blanks in a story with random words, creating humorous and often nonsensical results. Players take turns providing words without knowing the context, resulting in unexpected and entertaining narratives. 

I created this game as one of my first Python projects.

In this game, I used one package for coloring and formatting output text, named Simple_Colors (https://github.com/weaming/simple-colors), and also used ASCII code for coloring.
